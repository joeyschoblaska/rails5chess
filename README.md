# Rails 5 Chess
A simple chess server written in Rails 5 using Action Cable-powered WebSockets. Allows two (or more) people to play a live game of chess against each other.

I did a full blog post on how Action Cable was used here: http://jargon.io/joeyschoblaska/rails-5-chess-with-action-cable-websockets
